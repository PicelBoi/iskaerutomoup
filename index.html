            <h2>What is Kaerutomo?</h2>
            <p>
              A revival of Miitomo, a discontinued Nintendo social media service
              and their debut on the mobile gaming market.

          </section>
          <section>
            <h2>Why does this exist?</h2>
            <p>Because Kaerutomo goes down. A lot.</p>

            <h2>Why so basic?</h2>

                    Does it respond with an error code along the lines of

                    you may need to fix IdenTrust.

          <h2>This Is Meant To Be Fun</h2>
          <p>
            This site is meant to make fun of how Kaerutomo occasionally goes
            down, but we mean NO hate against the developers and the staff of
            such service. As such, please refrain from making any
            <b>threats</b> or
            <b

              we can</b
            >
            to the staff and such - it takes an lot of effort to take care of a
            service like Kaerutomo.
