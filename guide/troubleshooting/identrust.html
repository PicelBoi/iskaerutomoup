            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>
              Miitomo is refusing to connect to Kaerutomo servers because the
              certificates used to verify that the server you're connecting to
              is actually the server you're connecting to have expired and are
              unusable.
            </p>
          </section>
          <hr />
          <h2>The Solution(s)</h2>
          <p>Install the newer certificate onto your Android/iOS device.</p>
          <ul>

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Using a web browser of your choice on your Android device,
                    go to
                    <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/certs/2024/r11.pem"

                    >
                    and download the certificate.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    After downloading it, open the file and Android should guide
                    you through installing such certificate. After that,
                    Kaerutomo should load, and you should follow
                    <a href="guide/firstboot.html">this guide</a> for what
                    happens after if you're new to Kaerutomo or need a brush up.

                  <li>
                    If it doesn't install, go to your phone's settings app and
                    (this can vary between version, devices, and brands, this is
                    according to a LG device on Android 5.1.1)<br /><b>

                  <li>
                    Install for VPNs and Apps (or if that doesn't work, also
                    install for WiFi as well.)

                    If you don't have it, you need ADB (Android Debug Bridge)
                    for this to work. I recommend using
                    <a
                      href="https://xdaforums.com/t/tool-minimal-adb-and-fastboot-2-9-18.2317790/"
                      >Minimal ADB and Fastboot</a
                    >, as it is simple to install. For Linux, refer to your
                    distribution's methods or install like how Google would do
                    it. (This also applies to macOS w/o referring to the whole
                    distribution part.)
                    <a
                      href="https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools"

                    >
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Launch a command-line prompt (Windows, this would be the
                    Command Prompt or Windows Terminal. For macOS, this would be
                    the included Terminal app. For Linux, your DE's or your
                    preferred terminal emulator)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If you're doing this on an actual device, I assume you know
                    how to enable USB Debugging (if not, Settings - About phone
                    - Build Number - press 5 times. Then go to Settings -
                    Developer options - USB Debugging.) Refer to your emulator's
                    instructions on how to connect via ADB.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Using a web browser of your choice on the computer you're
                    running ADB on, go to
                    <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/certs/2024/r11.pem"
                      >https://letsencrypt.org/certs/2024/r11.pem</a
                    >
                    and download the certificate.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Do <q>adb devices</q> and check if you have multiple
                    devices. If so, disconnect the other device.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Move the certificate to anywhere you want using MTP or
                    <q>adb push</q>. If you're using MTP, assume that the path I
                    will mention on later steps will be /sdcard/Directory you
                    put the certificate at/r11.pem (EXAMPLE:
                    /sdcard/Downloads/r11.pem) unless you know the path already.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Launch <q>adb shell</q> and on the shell, type in and enter
                    <q>su</q>. This puts your shell in superuser mode, which
                    requires root access. This will allow us to later move the
                    certificate to where we want it to be.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Do
                    <q
                      >cp PATH_TO_CERTIFICATE
                      /system/etc/security/cacerts/4cdd6f92.0</q
                    >
                    to copy the certificate to the right place for Android to
                    use.
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        If you receive a "read-only" file system error, execute
                        <q>mount -o rw,remount /</q>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Do <q>chmod 664 /system/etc/security/cacerts/4cdd6f92.0</q>.
                    This will set the correct permissions for Android to access
                    such certificate.
